# Fly green


## Overview 📖
**Fly green** is a single page app based on flight footprint.

The app is structured in different sections:

* Main section where you can choose a departure and a destination city.
In addition you can select pass number.

* Result section where you can find out single pass footprint, total fooprint and ticket price.

* Compared sections where are compared bus and train emissions compared to airplane ones.

* Final section includes airlines emissions chart and destination countries grid

## Features 📝

The app has been created with React.

I implemented:

* **React Router** for the paths, that allowed me to keep the status of a SAP.
* **React Icons** for the icons.
* **Axios** to optimize Api requests.
* **React Hooks** as UseState, UseEffect, UseNavigate, useParams to manage the state and perform a better app.
* **Material UI** for components like Autocomplete and list.


Conditional rendering has been used to display the survey or compared in Compared section.
